Iâ€™m beyond excited to announce the completion of my React-based IMDb replica! ðŸŒŸ This project has been a thrilling journey, evolving from a basic movie display to a fully-featured site with advanced filtering, sorting, genre-based filtering, and more. Leveraging the power of the TMDB API, React Router DOM, and seamless pagination, this site offers a user-friendly experience that makes finding your favorite movies a breeze. ðŸš€
